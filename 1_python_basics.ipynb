    "Please make sure you understand everything mentioned here and are able to solve the exercises in the next notebook!\n",
    "\n",
    "This is only a very brief introduction, mostly intended for people who already know a bit about computer science. If you feel this does not provide enough information for you, please consider looking at these additional references:\n",

    "For bonus points, also have a look at the official [**Python Code Style Guide**](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/). \n",

    "You can execute the code in the cells by clicking into a cell and pressing \"shift\"+\"enter\" or clicking the \"run\" button at the top. Feel free to experiment a bit by changing the code in the examples to see what happens. Don't worry if you get any error messages - consider them hints on how to do better ;-)\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of just running through the examples, **it helps to first think about what you would expect the output of a code cell to be and then execute it to see if you were right**. If you weren't, please make sure you understand why and what is happening in the code!\n",
    "\n",
    "If you see a number in the square brakets next to a cell (e.g. `In [1]`), then the cell was already executed. If the brakets are empty, run the cell to execute the code in it and see the output. If you want to try out something else but not erase the given code, press the \"+\" button at the top to add a new cell below the currently selected cell. \n",
    "\n",
    "You have to execute all the cells starting at the beginning for everything to work as expected. If you change any variable names or their values, be prepared for different outcomes. You can execute cells multiple times and jump back and forth; the number next to the cell tells you the order of execution - if a cell below changes a variable used in the cell above it and you execute the cell above again, the output might be different from before as it uses the updated variable value. \n",
    "\n",
    "Should the code get stuck (`In [*]` means the cell is currently executing the code in it; in our examples this should never take more than a few seconds), click the \"stop\" button at the top or select \"Kernel > Interrupt\" from the menu bar."

Often, this is good, since it shows us that we didn't think of something and should go back and improve our code. Other times though, errors are expected behavior and we don't want them to cause our program to come to a complete halt. Instead, we can wrap code that might throw an error at some point (e.g. a request to a website that can be temporarily unavailable) in a `try`-`except`-block:\n",
