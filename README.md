# Python Tutorial

This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks to teach you the basics in Python that you need for the Machine Learning Workshop.

If you already have Jupyter Notebook installed (which you need for the workshop!) you can download the repository, open Jupyter Notebook on your computer, navigate to the repository folder, and click on one of the notebooks to open it and work with it. If you don't get that to work you can also work in an online version of Jupyter Notebook by following [this link](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/cod3licious/python_tutorial/master) (right-click to open in a new tab; might take a while to launch).

In any case you should see something like this:

Start with `1_python_basics.ipynb`, which contains the introductory Python tutorial. Just click on it and a new tab with the notebook should open:

The tutorial is supposed to be interactive, which means you are supposed to execute code yourself and experiment with the given examples to better understand what is going on. To execute a so-called "cell" with code in it, make sure the cell is selected (has a colored boarder around it), and click run (or press "shift"+"enter" on your keyboard). After the cell was successfully executed, the `In [ ]:` next to it will change to something like `In [5]:`.


Execute all the cells from top to bottom!

See you at the workshop!
