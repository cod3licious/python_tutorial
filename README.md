## Python Tutorial

This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks to teach you the basics in Python that you need for the Machine Learning Workshop.

If you already have Jupyter Notebook installed (which you need for the workshop!) you can download the repository (click the green "Clone or download" button at the top and then "Download ZIP"), open Jupyter Notebook on your computer, navigate to the repository folder, and click on one of the notebooks to open it and work with it. If you don't get that to work you can also work in an online version of Jupyter Notebook by following [this link](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/cod3licious/python_tutorial/master) (right-click to open in a new tab; might take a while to launch).

In any case you should see something like this:

Start with `1_python_basics.ipynb`, which contains the introductory Python tutorial. Just click on it and a new tab with the notebook should open:

The tutorial is interactive, i.e., you are supposed to execute the code yourself and experiment with the given examples to better understand what is going on. To execute a so-called "cell" with code in it, make sure the cell is selected (has a colored border around it), and click run (or press "shift"+"enter" on your keyboard). After the cell was successfully executed, the `In [ ]:` next to it will change to something like `In [5]:`.

Execute all the cells from top to bottom!

After you're done with the tutorial, look at `2_exercises.ipynb`, which contains some exercises that you should complete. The solutions to the exercises can be found in `3_exercise_solutions.ipynb` (but try to first solve them yourself!!).

When you're comfortable with the basics, have a look at `4_numpy_pandas.ipynb`, which gives a quick introduction to the basic data science Python libraries numpy, pandas, and matplotlib. While we will also review these libraries at the beginning of the workshop again, exploring them on your own first will really help you when it is time to work on the exercises in the workshop.

If you have any questions, please drop me a line at `franzi[at]datasc.xyz`.

See you at the workshop!
